For the sample of good code I have included:

Hero.java
Move.java
MoveLeft.java
MoveRight.java
MoveUp.java
MoveDown.java

in this directory. All of the Move* files are new
and I worked on re-writing the method walk
in Hero.java

Please see this method at line 120 of Hero.java to see
my changed code and see all of the move files for
all my new code.
