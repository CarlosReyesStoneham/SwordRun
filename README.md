SwordRun
========

Sword run is a top-down perspective game.
It is similar to legend of zelda for gameboy
the major difference being that it is level based
rather than free-world.
The goal of this game is to finish all of the levels
and beat the final boss on the last level.
Essentially as the main character you must walk around each
level and defeat all of the enemies with your sword before
getting to the next level, use the arrow keys to navigate and
the wasd keys to attack.
For each level you beat, the enemies will be harder to
defeat, and thus you will be given more life.
